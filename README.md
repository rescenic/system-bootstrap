### The `programs.csv` list

Parses the given programs list and install all given programs.
Can handle:
  - AUR packages
  - Python via pip
  - Git repos (assuming it uses `Make` for compilation)
  
The first column is a "tag" that determines how the program is installed, ""
(blank) for the main repository, `A` for via the AUR or `G` if the program is a
git repository that is meant to be `make && sudo make install`ed.

##### Check which programs arent installed

```sh
$ programs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladdoster/dotfile-installer/master/programs.csv"
$ printf "\n" && echo "$(curl -s "$programs" | sed '/^#/d')" | \
  while IFS=, read -r tag program comment; do
   if [[ $tag == 'G' ]]; then 
       printf "$program might not be installed because it is from git\n" 
   else 
       printf "$(pacman -Qi "$program" > /dev/null)"
   fi;  done
```
